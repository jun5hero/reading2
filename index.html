  <h1>Reading Response 2:
      <br/>“Vernacular Web”
      </h1>

      <h2>-Summary-

        <h3>
          What is a Web in the 90s?</h3>
          <p>
            It was the web of the indegenous or barbarians
          Amateur web is hidden but didn’t disappear.
          The trend of web design also circulates like fashion
          These are the work of the past.
          What did these visual, acoustic and navigation elements stand for? For which cultures and media did these serve as a bridge to the web? What ambitions were they serving? What problems did they solve and what problems did they create?</p>



          <h3>Under Construction</h3>

          <p>
            Very strong symbol in the early web
          Used in the past because of underdeveloped pages and links but these days, it became less necessary as the web developed.
          The image didn’t disappear but changed the meaning delivered to the visitors as an invitation and excuse.
          The sign “always under construction” gives a different message that there is always someone working on it.
          This soon disappeared and changed.
          the new sign says the developers of the sites are taking care to reconstruct the web to meet new standards and to bring the "world's biggest trash pile" into a faultless, clean and clear code environment.</p>



          <h3>The Starry Night Background</h3>

          <p>Early Web had this night features bc a lot were Sci-Fi related
          Solved the size problem with background colors but didn’t have a fit with any concrete idea.
          But depending on the usage like “anti” the star background still exists.</p>



          <h3>Free Collections of Web Elements</h3>

          <p>paper, glass, water and wood themes came later.
          Lots of images, animations, colors, buttons, bullets, and dividers were used to express certain themes and moods.</p>


          <h3>Links</h3>

          <p>The way it looked was derived from the underlying architecture.
          The concept was different 2, 5, 10 years ago.
          The principles of vernacular web’s growth was links.
          Links -- the once typical means of conveyance -- have lost their infrastructural importance.
          Search engines, portals and catalogues took over the linking responsibilities making searches faster and less surprising.</p>


          <h3>MIDI</h3>

          <p>Music in the MIDI format before MP3.
          MIDI collections differ from graphics collections: supply exceeds demand.</p>


          <h3>Frames</h3>

          <p>HTML frames allow authors to present documents in multiple views, which may be independent windows or subwindows. Multiple views offer designers a way to keep certain information visible, while other views are scrolled or replaced.
          Frames provide a common ground for professionals and amateurs, early adopters and newcomers.
          Frames create a very recognizable visual pattern.


          </p>

          <br/><br/>

        <h2>-My Personal thought-</h2>

        <p>The vernacular web could be considered as the America Continent to Columbus. A whole new field and world with unknown geometry, creatures, and weather. You might be able to encounter new people or be able to grow new types of crops. To the early adopters a.k.a amateurs could do anything to explore and find out what could be done and what couldn't.

        <br/><br/>
        All of these old style features of the web is really the basis of what we are using right now as the internet. These might be considered outdated to us but not to them. We might be also considered amateurs when the children of the future view us when we are using something for the first time like VR and AR tech.
